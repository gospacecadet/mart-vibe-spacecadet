      SPK09

      It you just make typecast or was that I there right. This is typing faster man a bit there yeah yeah that's a little like a bastard

      SPK09

      That struck a mentor sent on your resident startup advocate commercial member trucking off a star calm technical muscle and co founder of one of the world's largest hosting companies rack space you're listening to the SA large far apart cast about starting a business that help start other businesses by activating space and communities I'm Stephen king to near cofounder and fleet amount of space cadet that I owe and online marketplace that lets you in commercial space for one month or less from local landlords in businesses This

      SPK00

      this is this is this for me E series

      SPK02

      we hope you're able to learn how to spread the word about space cadet it me inspired to go out and try your own idea or go with this is to help tell our story button the stories of the people who use basically that make our crew. And the people were encouraged inspire us in a way to represents a peek into them

      SPK00

      this it's are it's it's you know

      SPK02

      we have no idea how the stories gonna turn out we're right in it along every day day by day I'm a senate on your native born raised which to john yeah high school first graduating class of the science academy lived in Boston for ten years. Then austin for year. And the back here for three and half years now in San Antonio I genuinely believe that when the middle the cultural renaissance. And you see it across the CD in all sectors and segments of the life that we leave here. And they were gonna park as before. And even though I've spoken hundreds and thousands of people that I'm I'm human and I get nervous too and one of the days that I was recording. And thinking about what I was gonna be working on I ask my wife Sabrina you know was which she nervous for me what did she think you know being is she's around me so often no wonder there is three oh and here really your talk or your natural talker you're great at talking. And it your great storyteller. So I just think your natural really think anything you worry about the only thing I worry about is that you're getting "'cause" I eerie feeling like you're right but I don't see your project you do it at a PC you can handle. And you do is only eighteen you know right. And I just feel like what you get overwhelmed or feel thing that you shouldn't be feeling like I

      SPK00

      like that thinking because that

      SPK09

      you're doing that's that's something we dedicated anyway

      SPK00

      you know you know it is I'm waiting be

      SPK09

      a pleasure for you and not so anything to get ahead I think that's difficult for a lot of people think it's yeah okay yeah I I appreciate that very much. That's maybe the same back to that and hearing that encouragement it's a big reason as to why pressed on and why you're hearing this now why it's been released it makes you remember that I'm not the only one that's working on this I'm not the only one that's doing this day in and day out. I'm gonna cofounder Mormon arnold. He space cadets flea ship right. And losing your lens. And for those of you who don't know what a ship right is it's a person who's been in the tree of ER shipbuilding sort of the guy who steering the ship marvin's the guy was building the ship. So in some circles you've got a CTL and we've been buddies since we were ready mighty together. And he's quite literally one of the best people that I know yeah

      SPK00

      we recorded it and had probably quarter cult you'd be recorded right I I I I run differently recorded. I I I I I the the exactly individually thing unavailable for and then the the whatever the that are incredible on working working will be in the and it's a chill maybe it won't work like that and all the I mean well I mean if I don't have a I'm I'm a little bit worried about the Ventura we want to be that become successful. And it actually a won't hold your economy. So yeah I think there's a lot of unknown there. And the the only potential for that like improve the world but I think there's a somewhere that we can handle making more inequitable. Um maybe so like I I work physical according case right. Um I like with that one the property or anything I don't want to be that yeah really sure that whatever. Um right like one more minute and all that burned down. Um and the like or black near like mental right and all that stuff. Um and it kind of actually kind of a hard in when you figure you thinking too because it used to be like run by huge merchant and and the guy integrated usually only one of the black people would think that you think okay in the market I don't opened up an area kinda that rundown burn down the long term by and of course you have to traditional usual. And so I can imagine kind of worked out more control if the property when they want to be there probably gonna be more experienced a hundred people like neither economy and and increasing the gentrification I don't try a point yet we can really make you anything about it really we are trying to like really taken in consideration. But I think it'll work so like I mean I like all the potential that lion and then I'm not really sure where material change right kind of like generally. It's like that'd be in the the and the the driving or and hoping that you can write anything for the better part of that I don't know but I'm on the like very reluctant about all the sure economy and yeah we we we need to make it work or maybe like temporary workers it just that on at all interesting I'm not what or or in the bigger picture. Well and don't think I don't think any than average is about making helping out. And getting to a point where it is actually important to actually don't worry about the bigger picture thing this point we have to get up and running version of function worry about all that stuff okay for me I like and I'm still not over the for sure so I'm the point really focused on like giving that they Al and then looking like a puppet and and thinking what that I'm not talking about like a three month around and want to wait another week or two indolent right up and pointing down. Um and told and the building throwing from thinking about right I'm actually until just like in the the like camping out product learning technical I think that like if I don't really kind of engineering years group in general. Um and I I definitely have a really talk a little bit a like a bitch and a problem learning thing. Um I feel like considering to figure things out about the same time that like a more general near me collect I independently down like realise that the mission to the programming packages world after and I think they generally we wanted like that question don't need the yeah that back in the and and regroup viola what's going on with me personally yeah I've been trying to figure out you know like what I want in my life and only different thing and I think you know the more representation and the like started start it and I think I probably over by right and I had and when you know like the like more like you are location type of way of looking at it that you know we're really really you doing over and the lecture cardinal we think that maybe in the world. And no greater than making a lot of the environment in technology used in that way until I started working at things like why he applied on are you wanna like pushbutton meaning on the startup world. I think a lot of that that not they're like you feel like straight money making machine. Um and you can see it would bit like kind of social target like no one really knows what do you actually projects production to be added italian really it and I think it could it could be more overall divided by the author that actually just be like another target the oh for some kind of like more absolutely central value and right now because you don't know look at on like any product out there like kind of blind me. And that's really interesting. And I think it's up to like take that lightly and either you know you kind of like mine we till the big hurdle talking on it or find a more compelling story which I don't really think we found yeah

      SPK02

      martin is one am I trusted friends. It's obvious that he's a pretty smart dude too. So I listen to that even now it it really makes me wonder how we're gonna successfully tell the story of what it is really working on you know in the beginning of the episode we heard a clip from their government doors he just started it. He's tracking office technical muscle and is co founder of the world's number one manage cloud computing company rack space I want to get some feedback from them. And interact with them over the last couple years adam back. And you always been someone that was willing to provide that feedback and just give me genuine down to earth. Here's what I think but from a very hyper intelligent perspective. So I stopped by scalar sometime. And I met with Dirk and his brother Brett the one by their their line lab as they call it a that's also extremely intelligent grey feedback and we've that's amazing conversations with just a combined talking about the things are working on keep in mind that I'm in San Antonio in marvin's in new orleans. So for us to have a group meeting at this point in time involved one laptop. So that we could show the space cadet website and the other laptop. So that we could have Marvin and go hang out. And this is all one recording our conversation on my galaxy essex. So we pretty much more startup to extract from the get go

      SPK00

      everyone is a procedure we just rent it from the government when you register value or that you're really that W that I and I speak first experience I've seen some people question don't have like I like a good idea. I I I think yeah I I like that. So first one is the is is and then the next really out is facility what we need to get to that that right so that's how do they find they have and they decided there and had just gonna have changed a major story. Then transactions right and so that level out the rain outside that is how you attract more people to the space yeah promoting possibility regions are Julia just kinda you start at the very heart use if you can allocate what you really believe that you can change well usually okay whatever make changing what you feel your from for the Lexus okay so I was year. So right yeah right in the middle part okay yeah exactly the money. So then the second or developed going okay how we facilitate of preview they exchange keys or access those sorts of things. And whatever other regular all you have to be around after okay is there like while were talking about okay if you add value added service or just the like is any concept something here of use the space and you do something we need more money here and there. And so I guess what are you talking about what is your next forty work your way yeah okay okay so you're really finish your really finish doing this this kind of more whatever and that's something I didn't see from kind of quick preview is how monster geographic or you mean I mean austin austin have on ensuring that often so versus wants to yeah sure you're ready to make it didn't seem like you I have that you yeah you know it doesn't your yeah right so you're what you have too much buttons once exactly okay. So I guess in this thing it sounds like you have a version you have a designs for what's coming next or resources to do you get you get there. I mean what is the I guess once you once you can see this is making to the it just I this type faster yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right guess please get is all museums and yeah and then are you thinking explaining outside centennial or is it just oh yeah okay next was austin. Um for us when you might help unlike with martin on the down side of things. But we'd also like to

      SPK09

      risque a little more hours or on board

      SPK00

      well that we can start to get more inventory which we thought a sales force I mean we need someone help us to sell so I can do all the selling like you know money's Rwanda obviously which well extreme you know get a fuck because you combine. I sell at least. And then a a marketing site things. I just now our plant are gonna market my my eyes if you're looking for like one boarding and that sounds O four into local is look for people who it work call centres reasonable salary expectations and they were not treated like use and so you might be appreciative button from the phone and spending time people actually we've had wondering what people thought about being too quick to get off the phone like now spent a it's a it's a that yeah you're not measure that how many old yeah but but that it can be very work as for wheel drive. And that's right you've been quite yeah yeah this is you know for a bottle yeah oh and chop some pieces yeah I mean I think for most you mean like they're trying to maximise the deal. So they're trying to figure out how to make this this building like enough for what it means to for the time us or so that I mean think that's a big that's going to be on one in oh yeah you wanna make oh oh oh about oh did basically you had to manage the number pending potential reptiles. So on which no one too he also this then more since I was in proper I can just in my normal any time. But no one people be a one yeah well this one means of happening is is done the way you make money as a label is having right sort of simple hot whatever so that yeah that's it's complicated to make worked out like because there's a lot. There's like yeah yeah well I I hear on is side yeah yeah actually so took that has that little puppetry want you know you know you actually and remotes you can you can where I will be fun yeah that may be true. It's complicated to meet up with my speedy shoot only sounds like you have a problem with myself or what to probably I I I guess that's why don't looking at young stuff is if you look we actually you know label understand that runs say three or four days is actually making a well I then that's you know that's also it's easy to do things are working out when you have in your lease right it's hard your string all that stuff together yeah I don't want them an owner I used to know is way without the landlords make sure they are making money on there well so the inter a little bit of a cost

      SPK09

      what your calculations

      SPK00

      you don't look yours how much property taxes you're gonna all these on the property can any other means like you do a little bit cost. And then go okay now we're gonna chill into that would be the income stream you getting to see how far are you are on that's just tell you a little bit okay. So when you go by the way if you if the price is you said you have to pay sixty five at least you have three right six hundred days this year three to actually talk to your cost actually wondering but on the other hand the the warehouse the industrial space is she so many members it equal much good. So you could have D like more insurance extends then what's

      SPK09

      this is

      SPK02

      every time I have left from hanging out with jargon bread. And always molecular smarter but I'm also fell like I still had at some more questions. And learning to do as well. This time in particularly brought up some very good points things that we were definitely going to have to keep in mind and that just meant that the story. The real work was just beginning. It's not to say that now with all that's happened over these last several years since we first started tinkering with the idea what I was just an idea that began in three a starter piggy down then morphed into what's now space cadet since then we tell dozens of business is get going and you have a case study our tool having been successfully used one Saturday morning at the Farmers market here the historic pearl. I caught up with another close buddy of mine Mitch agony cofounder and seal local sprout other local startup based here in San Antonio

      SPK00

      Well that I grew up in new Hampshire reason I came down to San Antonio for the first time is because I went college your trinity after I graduated. I had been pitching all around town I pride point form I like hydroponic because it's good for the environment bunch ways pesticide free riverside three really water conservative in you could do in the middle of the city and so I knew that resolve my goals which are primarily environmental needed to work in a company that could scale of that's all those important problems started product worked out well and after I graduated I found an investor backed up that vision too. So but it's an interview for about seven years. But the CD productivity and it's a lotta good ideas and good vibrations available for me we so we have this real opportunity which is a sixteen thousand square foot warehouse and are intention was the farm in that warehouse but we didn't have the equipment or the labour or really any the infrastructure to make our business large enough at that time to fill up the whole where and so we had about three quarters of this beautiful space totally are utilised in the opportunity that we had was we'd like to surround ourselves with something they can produce revenue but something that works cohesive lee with the vision that we have this place which is probably sustainable food or innovation or startups in general but we didn't know exactly who needed that space. And so so we we don't although the warehouse locus probably had the opportunity to fill up that space the one the person who owns that building didn't know how to use it didn't know how to modifies it very well. But knew that they didn't wanna sell it off "'cause" it's in such a good area of town. So in order to help him and help us. We decided to take on a management role at the warehouse in exchange for not having to pay rent anymore if we can get enough friends from under tennis warehouse then we were off the hook and so space cadet was the idea came up a use in order to get other folks into that space get the revenue that we needed to subsidise our rents and hopefully generate enough revenue to also make it worth the while of the business owner or the property as a startup you're always looking to cut as many cost as possible as long as you're not diminishing your own work product now it did take us a little bit of time in order to set up the a region three space get it in an order to get tenants within that space but are cool ones that turned out the truth was that it would cost us very little to get new tenants into that space in exchange for the cost of things we would have on the right that we no longer had to pay. So pretty quickly we got a whole bunch of different tenants into that space that were exactly synonymous or directly collaborative with local sprout hydroponic farm. But were in I think quite similar to the start of notion that we're seeking to local sport had just established it it's first shipping container former operation and we're in the process of building out a greenhouse in partnership with the senator you would like we didn't have a lot of time to devote to management of other companies or anything really besides building informing and selling all of which are taxing in difficult especially in the middle of the city. So we started up with space could in order to put the listing online to get these folks in and with relatively little effort we marked off that area that yeah individual ten it would have with tape and say right this is your box in your box you may do whatever you would like it's your your area and we won't do anything or say anything about anything happens here unless it directly endangers or in payrolls the rest of the tenets of which didn't end up being a problem. I if I remember correctly correctly for the reason why space cadet switched from a storage model is because of the people who wanted to store their businesses as opposed to just their stuff because for a long time in even to this day there is at least one ten in that we have the just stores stuff but it turned out that storage space is the same as any other species and the same weather people use long term storage rental units for various other things. Uh like jeans or cookie or anything else. Once people were told that they could use a certain amount of square footage. However they wanted they came up with things that we couldn't possibly that building began as a whole printing press and so just because of digital media and how difficult journalism is in general. This printing press and then decide of San Antonio collapsed in terms of its business model I had to sell off the property it's as simple a building is can we imagine there are four walls. And a divider in the middle and a simple roof it's just a pure rectangle Q and within it the possibility seem to be endless one example of the mail I I wouldn't have guessed could have emerged is a rock climbing wall when all the way up to the top the ceiling. And in two hundred square feet one of our tenants decided to make that is own private you and then begin the idea of charging a membership fee for any other individuals who thought they might be interested in using a rock wall now you can end up building out that business model at that location but he has move or to do rock climbing wall exercise business ventures elsewhere and has also began using our space in a different context to base is wood and metal working shopping for his handiwork another example is someone who did old car maintenance work. So as opposed to like really large grinding in welding and powerful operations his was more the finesse the veneer the we'll adjustments I don't know know about cars but he was doing kind of the the more delicate work in a space where there was no real huge amount of equipment or a huge amount of overhead capability another ten it ended up using is space to store all of these audio visual equipment because he was doing freelance really R another person is just is stored old jogged out from errors and must things to sell in saudi Arabia where he's from so these businesses are are never communities that I would have directly engage with with the business opportunity of having space available for quite cheap and on flexible these terms meant that they had you either use the space over they want.

      SPK04

      this is this is silly all

      SPK02

      that happened was amazing to hear. S tool builders were always hoping that if at least one person can improve the quality of life than it was worth it image wasn't just talking about one person. He was talking about people people who were successfully taking one step closer to the real injuries because of the tool that we tell wasn't making a ton of money know how we raise the that underfunding no in fact we bootstrap this whole thing in having raise a single penny of funding but space cadet was helping people do were able to share a small part of the little victories they keep us all going after speaking with Mitch and the L mentors or anything you more from the other side of the marketplace from the ranchers the arch manoeuvres purse for that I want to grab a coffee at the historic role. And met up with Corey Clark founder of call that according space for creative is located on senate when used up and coming east side

      SPK00

      I very started with me recognising that was into what I truly loved in live I was running a landscaping company and it it was just something to make easy money and that's how I got started with the with the company and I was already six years into that business. Uh seven seven year decided to to let it go. And really try to figure out what I wanted to do and I'd been filming what a buddy of mine quite some time. And I was like well you know I I think I'm just gonna use some of the money I've I I made from something my my equipment my landscaping equipment to purchased camera equipment so I'd done so when I started getting some gigs here and there. And that was the keeper studio space and I was looking online looking on craig's list and I I got a response from from Stephen in hey I I have a few properties that I think would match you and I think you know like the price point. And I was I was okay that sounds interesting so I met with Steve and one of the properties and instantly it was the perfect perfect match I was like it was a thousand square feet in the space that I was able to choose I believe up to seven thousand that was available on that and so I I think it very started off with they three hundred with it's space used for storage. And the me time well I figured out how is house you know build on the studio will in in have an opportunity to have that much space for such a great price my mind started making what is much more I can do with this and we you know you not canoeing your mind so cynical what more can you do and so I thought I definitely. I thought well hey maybe I can just get a few of the people in in create like that shoot studio space so we can actually be a you know a lot of space and we could participate an even distribution of a cost the problem with that is I did some research and then I found that when the other that I presently I said and then to pass that there's all these issues and one one member of the space wanting to do something in the other member not one in and dining wanting to do something else. And nobody having complete control over the space so I did wanna go into that are trying to figure something out and then I heard a story about a local space in which was built out for artists and because the space had a lot of artists are it through a lot of attention from people so a lot of people started going to shows and events what happen over time is a little micro economy built up there restaurants and bars they came in and so therefore the studio space and living space the hardest that would stay at this location rose and the artists are no longer able to afford to live there but of course the business economy kept going in there was two events there's so what you had was a place that was cultivated by DR is but yeah it is basically people that build that space up or remove the dislocated from area because they can no longer afford it. So I wanted to build a space that I would be able to get more simple but I wanted them to fill confident comfortable that you know they can build their businesses here. But now just build and they can sustain then we were gonna be taken anybody out in that we wanted to make sure that they were priority. So yours actually try to these these creative these artists right I I was one myself and I figure out quickly and it's hard to make a living being a video for I can only imagine be an opinion that's why parameter it is for them so I wanted to do something like that in that space. I didn't know it was gonna be working I kind of figured out this is Corey king kind of after I built the business model well I was like oh wait a minute I think this is going. So once I got the business model and and I got everything planned out I was like I need to find funding is doing this by myself but amount expensive it just wasn't gonna happen I had a couple thousand of them won a couple thousand dollars. And I had a car that I was gonna sell and so what I did is I reached out to senator if it's a in sending for sorry presenting a film on face but can I had created critics as posing and I attach that correct dispersing into the speed of the space with groups. And integrates disposing it said through the first ten people that I have joined I will offer them two hundred dollars for six months which was resting here at that time. And that they would be able to meet me at that location nothing was built up by the way. So they'll maybe at the location on this day and it was ten people that came. And so these two people were a you know this random right also nice at the same time you know nothing was on the inside I would say it was kinda scared but I think the prisoner myself very well to them my just you know I showed them my idea is I I mean in the papers and listed everything out of plants what I was gonna do with two hundred dollars and how they would be initiated as a regional members in in their access to space in a different rules of the space. And know that in people to one colour that they so there I had a you know a big push for fishing instead of just had more money to be able to build out what I wanted to and then I sold my car so I close to six thousand dollars to to start the space but if the was the premier really crazy neck races that I don't know collaborative every came to fruition or very someone to go back to use and maybe in a space yeah in a small part of it I would definitely say the opposite just because that really gave me the opportunity to do what I not initially envisioned but as much manure was able to but yes. I now that I died and cynical working industry I I really what I've done a lot of research and almost every day I would say that some type of research into simple working. And the industry in the marketplace. And really how to help punch manoeuvres how to help start nuts and how to help create as an artist. Um so I've now am opening up to what they call working spaces one is that one that is set to open in two weeks from now that a guy that I had met came to me and said hey do you think we can do something with the space you know so I of course so long as we have the right business model in the in we put in an effective plan I think we could do an amazing thing with this place or human I became business partners. And that's basically will be launching. And the next week week and a half but that spaces primarily for startup companies now it's it's basically a start up a celebrated but with Monica working exhilarated we're gonna be it'll be an integration of like a weekly space with consulting business consultant from a professional consultants also who has a consulting company and then I am working on building at another colour in space in downtown Antonio right now as well.

      the first time I had heard cory recap all that he'd been able to accomplish. "'cause" we first met over a year ago I was completely blown away it was humbly to hear him say are tool having crucial for him you being able to do what he truly loved life. We aren't sure were journey will take us from here. But we or stories just beginning and we hope you'll stay tuned and this in
