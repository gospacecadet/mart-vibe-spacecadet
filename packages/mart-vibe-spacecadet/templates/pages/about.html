  <h3 class="m-t-3">Our Mission</h3>

  <p>
  To make Entrepreneurship accessible to all, and drive urban economic development with collaborative activation. By making it easier for entrepreneurs to utilize wasted space, more ideas and companies can contribute to their local economies. By activating a space, once empty for months - or even years - commercial real estate owners and professionals can focus on stimulating business and development into this area.  A space of your own to develop ideas is important, and so is the community that supports it. By joining SpaceCadet you will also have access to a network of partners that supports growth for property owners, brokers, and renters.
